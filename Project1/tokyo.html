    <p class="para1">Shibuya is one of the 23 city wards of Tokyo, but often refers to just the popular shopping and entertainment area found around Shibuya Station. In this regard, Shibuya is one of Tokyo's most colorful and busy districts, packed with shopping, dining and nightclubs serving swarms of visitors that come to the district everyday. It is a center for youth fashion and culture, and its streets are the birthplace to many of Japan's fashion and entertainment trends. Numerous department stores and shopping malls can be found around the area catering to all types of shoppers. Many of the area's large shopping complexes belong to either Tokyu or Seibu, two competing corporations.</p>

            <p class="para2">Meiji Shrine is a shrine dedicated to the deified spirits of Emperor Meiji and his consort, Empress Shoken. Located just beside the JR Yamanote Line's busy Harajuku Station, Meiji Shrine and the adjacent Yoyogi Park make up a large forested area within the densely built-up city. The spacious shrine grounds offer walking paths that are great for a relaxing stroll.</p>

            <p class="para3">Shibuya Crossing is one of Tokyo's most recognizable sights, pictured in countless films, magazines, and blogs. During its busiest times, an estimated 1,000 to 2,500 people forge their way across this intersection every two minutes, enough to quickly fill up a football stadium. The phenomenon gave rise to its nickname "scramble," as pedestrians cross from all directions. Shibuya Crossing walks the line between manic chaos and perfect synchronization. One of the scenes in The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift was filmed here. </p>
